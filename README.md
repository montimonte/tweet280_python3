# tweet280_python3
This repo is mainly based on https://github.com/anthonys-io/Tweet280. Fixed it for Python 3 so it should run from first start after you imported the respective dependencies.

You need to export your Twitter Cookie as .txt (e.g. with "Export Cookie") and put it in the same directory as the python script.
After this you can just run 

`python tweet280.py`

and enjoy your 280 chars.
